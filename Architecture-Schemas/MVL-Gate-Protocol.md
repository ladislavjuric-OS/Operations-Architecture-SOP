# MVL Gate Protocol
## Minimum Viable Launch — Decision Gate Framework

> "If you can't prove it on paper, you can't prove it with money."

---

## Purpose

The MVL (Minimum Viable Launch) Gate Protocol is a structured decision framework that prevents premature launches, premature scaling, and premature spend.

It translates the Forensic Audit verdict into **actionable gates** — specific conditions that must be met before proceeding. Each gate has a clear owner, deadline, and measurable pass/fail criteria.

This protocol is used when the audit produces a **Conditional GO** — the most common (and most dangerous) verdict, because it feels like permission but is actually a structured challenge.

---

## Core Principle: Gates, Not Hopes

Most projects fail not because the idea was bad, but because the team:
- Launched before the audience was ready
- Spent before the math was validated
- Scaled before the foundation could hold

MVL Gates force a binary answer at each checkpoint: **PASS or FAIL.**
No "we'll figure it out." No "it should be fine." Numbers or nothing.

## The Gate Structure

### Gate 0: Audit Complete
**Trigger:** Forensic Audit delivered with scored modules
**Pass criteria:**
- All 8 modules scored
- Overall readiness score calculated
- Verdict issued (GO / Conditional GO / NO-GO)
- Critical blockers identified and documented

**If NO-GO:** Stop. Restructure or pivot. No gates needed — the answer is clear.
**If GO:** Proceed to execution. Gates are advisory checkpoints.
**If Conditional GO:** Gates become mandatory. No gate skip = no launch.

### Gate 1: Financial Viability Lock
**Owner:** Founder + Finance
**Deadline:** Week 1 post-audit

**Pass criteria:**
- [ ] COGS validated with supplier quote (not estimate)
- [ ] Break-even price calculated and documented
- [ ] Pricing ladder set (Super Early Bird → MSRP)
- [ ] Margin check: Super Early Bird margin ≥ 10%
- [ ] Funding goal justified with line-item budget
- [ ] "Stupidity Tax" (5-20% contingency) included
- [ ] Cash flow projection: funding → production → fulfillment mapped

**Fail action:** Cannot proceed to Gate 2. Fix financials first.

---

### Gate 2: Demand Validation Signal
**Owner:** Marketing + Founder
**Deadline:** Week 2-3 post-audit

**Pass criteria:**
- [ ] Landing page live with email capture (conversion rate ≥ 20%)
- [ ] Paid ad test launched ($300-500 minimum spend)
- [ ] CPL (Cost Per Lead) measured and within benchmark ($1-5)
- [ ] Minimum 100 email signups from paid traffic
- [ ] VIP deposit offer tested ($1-5 pre-commit)
- [ ] At least 1 non-vanity signal of demand (deposits, waitlist, pre-orders)

**Fail action:** Extend pre-campaign. Do not launch without validated demand.

---

### Gate 3: Email List Threshold
**Owner:** Marketing
**Deadline:** 2-4 weeks before launch

**Pass criteria:**
- [ ] Email list reached minimum viable size (calculated from Goal ÷ Avg Pledge ÷ Conversion Rate × 3x buffer)
- [ ] List quality verified: open rate ≥ 25%, click rate ≥ 3%
- [ ] Source mix documented (organic vs. paid breakdown)
- [ ] Nurture sequence active (5-7 emails minimum)
- [ ] VIP segment identified and tagged

**Fail action:** Delay launch. Continue list building. Reassess timeline.

---

### Gate 4: Asset & Page Readiness
**Owner:** Creative + Founder
**Deadline:** 1-2 weeks before launch

**Pass criteria:**
- [ ] Campaign page / sales page complete and reviewed
- [ ] Campaign video final and approved
- [ ] Hero image A/B tested (if possible)
- [ ] All perk/tier/offer details finalized
- [ ] Trust elements in place (team, testimonials, certifications)
- [ ] FAQ section populated
- [ ] Press kit assembled

**Fail action:** Do not launch with incomplete assets. Every missing element = conversion leak.

---

### Gate 5: Technical Infrastructure
**Owner:** Ops / Technical
**Deadline:** 1 week before launch

**Pass criteria:**
- [ ] Tracking live: GA4, Pixel, UTM structure tested
- [ ] Email automation sequences connected and tested
- [ ] Platform account verified and payment setup confirmed
- [ ] CRM / backer management tool ready
- [ ] All integrations tested end-to-end
- [ ] Backup plan documented (what if X tool fails on Day 1)

**Fail action:** Fix before launch. Launching without tracking = flying blind.

---

### Gate 6: Day 1 Math Confirmation
**Owner:** Architect / Strategist
**Deadline:** 48-72 hours before launch

**Pass criteria:**
- [ ] Day 1 revenue target confirmed (30% of goal)
- [ ] VIP deposit → Day 1 backer conversion projected (50-80%)
- [ ] Email blast schedule locked (VIP → broader list → urgency)
- [ ] Media/PR embargo confirmed with outlets
- [ ] Influencer post schedule confirmed
- [ ] Team roles assigned for Day 1 (who does what, hour by hour)
- [ ] War Room dashboard live and populated

**Fail action:** LAUNCH FREEZE. If Day 1 math doesn't add up 48h before launch, postpone.

---

### Gate 7: GO/NO-GO Final Call
**Owner:** Founder (with Architect advisory)
**Deadline:** 24 hours before launch

**Pass criteria:**
- [ ] Gates 1-6 all PASSED
- [ ] No new P0 blockers emerged
- [ ] Team aligned and briefed
- [ ] Founder confirms GO decision in writing

**Outcome:**
- All gates passed → **🟢 LAUNCH**
- 1+ gates failed → **🔴 DELAY** — fix and re-gate
- Fundamental issue discovered → **🔴 ABORT** — back to audit

## Adaptation for Non-Launch Contexts

The MVL Gate Protocol isn't only for crowdfunding. It adapts to any high-stakes operational decision:

| Context | Gate Adaptation |
|---|---|
| **New hire / team scaling** | Gates = role design → candidate pipeline → interview → trial → full hire |
| **New market entry** | Gates = market research → demand test → pilot → scale |
| **Tool migration** | Gates = audit current → map requirements → test → migrate → verify |
| **Process rollout** | Gates = document → pilot with 1 team → iterate → company-wide |

The principle is universal: **don't proceed until the gate is passed.**

## The "30% Day-1 Rule" — The Math Behind Gate 6

For crowdfunding specifically, Gate 6 is built on this principle:

**~30% of the funding goal must be achievable in the first 24 hours.**

Why?
- Platform algorithms (Indiegogo, Kickstarter) reward early velocity
- Day 1 momentum triggers organic discovery and category ranking
- Social proof compounds — backers attract backers
- Without Day 1 traction, campaigns enter the "Valley of Death" early

**The reverse math:**
