# Spoke-and-Hub Model
## Multi-Division Resource Allocation Architecture

> "When one founder runs three businesses, you don't need three operating systems. You need one hub and disciplined spokes."

---

## Purpose

The Spoke-and-Hub Model is an operational architecture for founders and operators managing **multiple business units, divisions, or ventures simultaneously** — without losing control, duplicating effort, or burning out.

It solves the #1 problem of multi-venture operators: **context-switching without system-switching.**

## When You Need This

| Scenario | Symptom |
|---|---|
| Founder runs agency + product company | Priorities compete, teams don't know what's urgent |
| Operator manages 3+ client engagements | Each client has different tools, no unified view |
| Company has multiple divisions (sales, ops, marketing) | Silos form, leadership loses cross-division visibility |
| Venture studio with portfolio companies | Resource allocation is gut-feel, not data-driven |
| Solo operator with parallel revenue streams | Everything feels urgent, nothing gets finished |

**If you're managing 2+ entities that share resources (time, money, people, attention) — you need a hub.**

---

## Architecture Overview

### The Hub (Central Command)

The Hub is the **single source of truth** that sits above all divisions. It contains:

| Hub Component | Purpose | Update Cadence |
|---|---|---|
| **Executive Dashboard** | Cross-division KPI visibility | Real-time / daily |
| **Resource Allocation Map** | Who works on what, when | Weekly |
| **Financial Consolidation** | P&L per spoke + consolidated | Monthly |
| **Priority Stack** | Ranked initiatives across all spokes | Weekly |
| **Risk Register** | Cross-division risk exposure | Bi-weekly |
| **Decision Log** | Key decisions + rationale + owner | As needed |

**The Hub answers one question:** "Across everything I'm running, what matters most right now?"

### The Spokes (Division Operations)

Each Spoke is a **self-contained operating unit** with its own:

| Spoke Component | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Division Dashboard** | Spoke-specific KPIs and status |
| **Project Tracker** | Active projects, milestones, owners |
| **Team/Contractor Roster** | Who's allocated to this spoke |
| **Client/Stakeholder Map** | External relationships specific to this spoke |
| **Revenue Pipeline** | Spoke-specific revenue tracking |
| **SOPs** | Division-specific standard operating procedures |

**Each Spoke answers:** "What's the status of this specific division, and what does it need?"

### The Bridge (Connection Protocol)

The Bridge is what makes the model work. Without it, you just have separate businesses in separate tabs.

| Bridge Element | What It Does | How It Works |
|---|---|---|
| **Shared Resource Protocol** | Prevents double-booking of people/budget | Resource requests go through Hub allocation |
| **Cross-Spoke Dependencies** | Tracks when Spoke A needs something from Spoke B | Dependency flags visible in Hub Dashboard |
| **Escalation Path** | When a Spoke problem affects other Spokes | Auto-escalates to Hub when threshold is hit |
| **Unified Calendar** | Prevents deadline conflicts across Spokes | Master calendar with per-Spoke color coding |
| **Communication Router** | Ensures messages reach the right Spoke | Channel naming convention + routing rules |

## Implementation Blueprint

### Phase 1: Hub Setup (Week 1)

**Step 1: Define your Spokes**
- List every business unit, client engagement, or venture
- Assign each a name and color code
- Identify shared resources (people, tools, budget)

**Step 2: Build the Executive Dashboard**
- 3-5 KPIs per Spoke (no more)
- One "health score" per Spoke (Green / Yellow / Red)
- Consolidated view on a single screen

**Step 3: Create the Priority Stack**
- List top 3 priorities per Spoke
- Force-rank across all Spokes (what gets attention first?)
- Review and re-rank weekly

### Phase 2: Spoke Configuration (Week 2-3)

**For each Spoke:**
1. Set up division-specific dashboard
2. Define the 3-5 KPIs that matter for this Spoke
3. Assign team/contractor roster
4. Document active projects and milestones
5. Create or link Spoke-specific SOPs

**Key principle:** Each Spoke should be operable by someone OTHER than the founder. If you're the only one who can run it, it's not a Spoke — it's a dependency.

### Phase 3: Bridge Installation (Week 3-4)

1. Define resource allocation rules (who gets priority when resources conflict?)
2. Set up cross-Spoke dependency tracking
3. Create escalation thresholds (when does a Spoke issue become a Hub issue?)
4. Establish communication channels per Spoke
5. Install weekly Hub review cadence

---

## Operating Cadence

### Daily (15 min)
- Scan Hub Dashboard for red/yellow flags
- Check Bridge for cross-Spoke dependencies due today
- One priority action per Spoke (maximum)

### Weekly (60 min)
- Hub Review: Re-rank Priority Stack
- Resource check: Any conflicts for next week?
- Per-Spoke pulse: 5-min status from each Spoke lead
- Decision log: Any pending decisions that need resolution?

### Monthly (2-3 hours)
- Financial consolidation: P&L per Spoke + total
- Resource audit: Are people allocated where they create most value?
- Spoke health assessment: Any Spoke trending toward crisis?
- 90-day horizon: What's coming that needs Hub-level attention?

### Quarterly (Half-day)
- Strategic review: Are all Spokes still worth running?
- Kill/scale/maintain decision per Spoke
- Resource rebalancing for next quarter
- New Spoke evaluation (should we add anything?)

## Resource Allocation Rules

### The 60/30/10 Framework

For operators managing multiple Spokes with finite resources:

| Allocation | Target | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| **60%** | Primary Spoke | The one generating most revenue or closest to breakthrough |
| **30%** | Secondary Spoke(s) | Maintenance + growth, not exploration |
| **10%** | Hub Operations | Dashboard maintenance, cross-Spoke coordination, strategic thinking |

**When a Spoke is in crisis:** Temporarily shift to 80/10/10 until stabilized, then rebalance.

### Conflict Resolution Protocol

When two Spokes need the same resource at the same time:

1. **Revenue impact** — which Spoke loses more money if delayed?
2. **Client commitment** — which has a harder deadline?
3. **Strategic value** — which aligns more with 12-month goals?
4. **Reversibility** — which decision is harder to undo?

If tied after all four criteria: **default to the Spoke with external stakeholders** (clients > internal projects).

## Common Failure Modes

### 1. "Everything is the Hub"
**Symptom:** Founder tries to manage everything centrally, Spokes have no autonomy.
**Fix:** If a decision only affects one Spoke, it stays in that Spoke. Hub only handles cross-Spoke issues.

### 2. "Spokes without Bridges"
**Symptom:** Each division operates independently, no cross-division visibility.
**Fix:** Weekly Hub review is non-negotiable. If you skip it, you're running separate businesses — not a system.

### 3. "The Founder IS the Hub"
**Symptom:** All coordination routes through one person. Bottleneck guaranteed.
**Fix:** Document the Bridge protocols so someone else can run Hub operations. The founder should own strategy, not routing.

### 4. "Too many Spokes"
**Symptom:** 5+ active Spokes with meaningful resource needs.
**Fix:** The human brain can hold 3-4 contexts effectively. If you have 5+ Spokes, either merge, delegate, or kill.

### 5. "Hub without teeth"
**Symptom:** Dashboard exists but nobody acts on the data.
**Fix:** Every Hub metric must have a trigger. Green = no action. Yellow = review within 48h. Red = action within 24h.

## Spoke-and-Hub Diagnostic

Use this checklist to assess whether your current multi-entity operation has a functioning Hub:

| Question | Yes | No |
|---|---|---|
| Can you see the health of ALL divisions on one screen? | ✅ Hub exists | ❌ Build one |
| Do you know how your resources are allocated this week? | ✅ Bridge works | ❌ Install resource map |
| Can someone else run the weekly coordination review? | ✅ Hub is documented | ❌ Document the process |
| When two divisions conflict, is there a clear resolution rule? | ✅ Protocol exists | ❌ Define conflict rules |
| Do you review all divisions at a fixed cadence? | ✅ Cadence installed | ❌ Set the rhythm |
| Can you identify which division needs the most attention right now? | ✅ Priority stack works | ❌ Create priority ranking |

**Score:**
- 6/6: System is operational. Optimize.
- 4-5/6: Foundation exists. Fill the gaps.
- 2-3/6: Partial system. Rebuild with this framework.
- 0-1/6: No system. Start at Phase 1.
