# Operational Blueprints Index
## Structural Frameworks for Multi-Domain Operations

> "Most businesses suffer from Operational Obesity — too many tools, too many 'overdue' tasks, and zero visibility."

This index catalogs the architectural blueprints behind Juric OS — the structural logic that governs how complex businesses are diagnosed, rebuilt, and scaled.

These aren't project plans. They're **engineering schematics** for operational systems.

## 1. Nashville Architecture™

**Purpose:** Single source of truth — every process, every KPI, every owner documented and traceable.

**Core principles:**
- One system of record (no parallel spreadsheets)
- Every task has an owner (if nobody owns it, it doesn't exist)
- Every process has a trigger (conditions, not memory)
- Every output has a consumer (if nobody uses the report, kill it)

**4 implementation layers:** Command (strategy) → Operations (execution) → Intelligence (data/KPIs) → Communication (rhythm/escalation)

**Tool-agnostic:** Implemented across Notion, ClickUp, Asana, Monday.com, and hybrid stacks. The logic survives platform migration.

## 2. Spoke-and-Hub Model

**Purpose:** Multi-divisional resource allocation without context-switching friction.

**The structure:** Central Hub (founder — strategy + capital) connects to independent Spokes (each with own P&L, KPIs, and team lead). Bridge SOPs define how spokes share resources. Kill Criteria define when a spoke gets shut down — numbers decide, not feelings.

**Application:** Originally designed for Venture Studio / Agency hybrids. Now applied to any founder running 2+ business units.

## 3. Forensic Audit Framework

**Purpose:** Full-spectrum operational diagnosis before any buildout.

**8-module scoring system** across a 100-point scale:

| Module | What It Measures |
|---|---|
| Financial Infrastructure | P&L clarity, margin analysis, COGS accuracy |
| Process Documentation | SOP coverage, ownership, repeatability |
| Team & Delegation | Role clarity, decision authority, founder dependency |
| Technology Stack | Tool redundancy, data flow, automation maturity |
| Revenue Architecture | Funnel health, conversion tracking, offer structure |
| Customer Operations | Support systems, retention, feedback loops |
| Compliance & Risk | Legal, regulatory, contractual exposure |
| Scalability Readiness | Can this grow 3x without breaking? |

**Verdict framework:** GO (≥65, no module below 40) → Conditional GO (40-64, clear improvement path) → NO-GO (<40, or any critical module at 0). Binary. No "maybe."

## 4. MVL Gate Protocol

**Purpose:** Minimum Viable Launch — the checkpoints that must pass before committing resources.

**Gate structure (crowdfunding example):** Demand validation → Email infrastructure → Financial model → Product readiness → Platform compliance → Ad infrastructure.

**The 30% Day-1 Rule:** (List size × conversion rate × avg pledge) ≥ 30% of goal. If the math doesn't work → don't launch, build more list.

**Gate logic:** All GREEN or YELLOW (with documented risk acceptance) before launch. Any RED = automatic freeze.

---

## 5. KPI Scorecard Architecture

**Purpose:** The 5-10 numbers that actually predict business health.

**Design principles:** Leading over lagging metrics. Owner-assigned. Green/yellow/red thresholds defined — no ambiguity.

---

## 6. The Accountability Rhythm

**Purpose:** Replace ad-hoc firefighting with a predictable cadence.

| Frequency | Focus |
|---|---|
| **Daily** | Blockers, priorities, handoffs (10-15 min) |
| **Weekly** | KPI status, red items, decisions (30-45 min) |
| **Monthly** | Trend analysis, resource allocation (60-90 min) |
| **Quarterly** | OKRs, kill/continue decisions, 90-day sprints (half day) |

**Rule:** If a meeting doesn't produce a decision or surface a blocker, it shouldn't exist.

---

## 7. Delegation Map Framework

**Purpose:** What the founder *stops* doing, who owns it, how to verify it works.

**Founder audit categories:** 🟢 Keep (only founder can do) → 🟡 Delegate (with SOP + owner + check) → 🔴 Eliminate (nobody should do).

> *"The goal is not to be needed. The goal is to build a system that doesn't need you."*

---

> ⚠️ **Full implementation guides — including scoring rubrics, KPI templates, delegation worksheets, and cadence playbooks — are available to active clients.** What you see here is the architectural logic. The customized build happens during engagement.
