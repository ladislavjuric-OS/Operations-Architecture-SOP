# The 101st Day Epilogue
## What Happens After the Campaign Ends

> "Shipping is where the profit goes to die."

Most guides stop at "Congratulations, you're funded!" This is where the real operations begin. The 101st day is the first day your backers stop caring about your story and start caring about their package.

## 1. The "Money-In" Period (Days 1–14)

Platforms take ~14 days to process funds. Your actual budget is NOT the headline number:

| Deduction | Impact |
|---|---|
| Platform fee | ~5% |
| Payment processing | ~3-5% |
| Failed payments | ~3-5% |
| **Effective net** | **~85-89% of gross** |

**Failed Payment Protocol:** 3-5% of cards fail. Direct message every dropped backer — 48-hour recovery window. ~50% will recover.

---

## 2. The Backer Survey (Data Harvest)

Don't use the platform's native survey for complex products. Use a dedicated Pledge Manager (BackerKit or equivalent) for validated addresses, variant selection, and — critically — **post-campaign upsells** (last chance to increase AOV).

**The Shipping Gap:** If you didn't charge shipping during campaign → charge it now. Protects against freight cost fluctuations.

**VAT/Tax:** Collect at survey stage for EU/UK/AU backers. Failure = customs nightmares and refund demands.

---

## 3. Manufacturing & QC Execution

**Golden Sample lock** before any mass production order. Weekly production updates to backers — even if there's no news. Silence = anxiety = refund requests.

**The 10% Buffer:** Order 10% more than needed. Covers shipping damage, lost packages, DOA replacements, and warranty claims. This is insurance, not waste.

---

## 4. The Global Logistics Puzzle

**Low volume (<500 units):** Ship from one central hub. Simple but slow.
**High volume (500+):** Regional hubs (USA, EU, Asia). Faster delivery, lower customs friction, but more complex 3PL management.

**3PL integration** with Pledge Manager = automatic tracking numbers. No manual work.

**The weight trap:** Weigh final packaging with ALL inserts before setting shipping prices. A weight category jump on 1,000 units = five-figure loss.

---

## 5. Post-Delivery & The Second Wave

**30-day warranty** defined before products ship. Clear DOA policy, response time commitment, replacement criteria.

**The transition:** Campaign end ≠ sales end. Immediate migration to InDemand or Shopify pre-order. Backer unboxing content becomes organic social proof → capture that traffic.

---

## 6. The Uncomfortable Truth

- 20-30% of margin gets consumed by unplanned logistics.
- Customer support peaks 2-4 weeks *after* first deliveries, not during the campaign.
- Your reputation is built in fulfillment, not funding. $500K funded with late delivery and quality issues = failure. $50K funded with on-time quality delivery = launchpad.

**This is why we build fulfillment architecture *before* launch, not after.** The 101st day should be executing a plan that was ready on Day 0.

---

> ⚠️ **Full fulfillment playbooks — including 3PL vendor selection criteria, VAT compliance workflows, pledge manager configuration guides, and shipping cost calculators — are available to active clients.** What you see here is the operational logic. The implementation is customized per product and market.
