# Launch Warfare Essentials
## The Operational Playbook for High-Stakes Campaign Execution

> "Launch hour is a sprint; the rest of the month is a marathon. Win the sprint."

This document outlines the critical SOPs that govern the **72-hour window** around a crowdfunding launch — the period that determines whether a campaign lives or dies.

---

## 1. The 14-Day Pre-Launch Warm-Up

**Goal:** Build anticipation and ensure a massive surge of backers within the first 60 minutes.

**The method:** A strategic 5-email crescendo — not spam, but a psychological ramp from announcement → emotional hook → scarcity reveal → social proof → final countdown → LIVE trigger.

**Key principles:**
- "Plain Text" email feel bypasses Promotions tab and increases open rates to 30-40%
- One CTA per email — clarity converts, confusion kills
- Segment "High Interest" clickers for a VIP launch-minute notification

## 2. Ad-Spend & ROAS Framework

**Goal:** Maximize Return on Ad Spend using a phased, data-driven approach.

**3-Phase structure:**

| Phase | Focus | Budget Allocation |
|---|---|---|
| **Pre-Launch** | Lead generation, CPL < $3.00 | 30% of total |
| **Launch Day** | Retargeting + email match surge | 10% of total |
| **Scaling** | ROAS ≥ 3x winners, Lookalike Audiences | 60% of total |

**Kill logic:** If spend reaches 2x target CPA with zero conversions → kill. If Frequency > 3.0 → refresh creative.

> *"Trust the dashboard, not your ego. Data over drama."*

## 3. The "Zero-Hour" Launch Protocol

**Goal:** Generate a massive spike in traffic and funding within the first 60 minutes, triggering the platform's algorithm.

**The timeline:**

| Window | Action |
|---|---|
| T-15 min | Final tech check — links, tiers, team online |
| Min 0–10 | VIP email blast to warm list |
| Min 10–20 | Personal direct outreach (WhatsApp/SMS) to 50-100 contacts |
| Min 20–45 | Social media blitz across all platforms |
| Min 45–60 | Command center — respond to comments, verify ads, check 30% Day-1 pace |
| Post-hour | First campaign update with funding graph screenshot |

**The 30% Day-1 Rule:** If you're not at 20-30% of goal within hours, identify friction and adjust live.

## 4. Post-Launch Momentum Engine

**Goal:** Maintain backer engagement and prevent the mid-campaign death spiral.

**Frequency protocol:**
- Launch Week: every 24-48h (milestones)
- "The Slump" (Days 10-25): every 3-4 days (deep dives, BTS)
- Final 48h: every 12-24h (urgency)

**4 update archetypes:** Milestone → Deep Dive → Stretch Goal → Cross-Promo

**Valley of Death countermeasures:** Shift narrative from "Buying" to "Building." Backer surveys, referral contests, and community participation triggers.

## 5. The Final 48-Hour FOMO Checklist

**Goal:** Maximize the closing surge through structured urgency.

**Execution layers:**
- **T-48h:** Campaign update + email blast to non-backers + social header swap
- **T-24h:** Price hike warning + 100% ad budget to retargeting + scarcity posts
- **T-12h:** Final email + founder live in comments
- **T-2h:** Micro-blast to openers who didn't click
- **Post-close:** Thank-you update + immediate migration to InDemand/Shopify

---

## 6. Community Management & The Comment War

**Goal:** Maintain morale, build trust through radical transparency, neutralize negativity.

**The Comment Matrix:** 4 backer archetypes (Super-Fan, Analyst, Skeptic, Troll) — each with a defined response protocol.

**Crisis protocol:** "Kill them with kindness and data." No defensiveness. Acknowledge → evidence → let community defend.

**The FAQ Engine:** If 3 people ask the same question → it goes in the FAQ. No exceptions.

> *"One raw video is worth a thousand words of 'Trust me.'"*

---

> ⚠️ **Full execution protocols, tactical checklists, email templates, and ad creative frameworks are available to active clients.** What you see here is the structural logic — the "what" and "why." The "how" is implemented during engagement.
