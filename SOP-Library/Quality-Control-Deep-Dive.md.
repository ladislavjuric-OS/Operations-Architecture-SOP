# SOP: Manufacturing & Quality Control (QC) Protocol

**Objective:** Bridging the gap between design and mass production with zero tolerance for error.

### 1. The Golden Sample Protocol
- **Validation:** No mass production starts without a 100% verified Golden Sample signed by the Lead Architect.
- **Tolerance Limits:** Defining the +/- margins for materials and assembly before the first unit leaves the line.

### 2. Factory Handoff Checklist
- Technical Drawings (PDF/CAD) review.
- Packaging stress-test standards.
- Labeling and compliance check (CE, FCC, RoHS).

### 3. Defect Management
- Threshold for batch rejection.
- Feedback loop logic: Factory -> Logistics Hub -> Operations Manager.
