# Launch Day Operations
## Hour-by-Hour D-Day Execution Playbook

> "Launch day is not when the work starts. It's when the preparation is tested."

---

## Purpose

This is the operational playbook for the most critical 24-48 hours of any campaign or product launch. Every action, every channel, every team member — mapped to a specific time slot.

Launch Day is not about creativity. It's about **execution discipline.** The strategy was decided weeks ago. Today is about hitting marks.

## Emergency Protocols

### If page/platform goes down:
1. Immediately contact platform support
2. Redirect all traffic to landing page with email capture
3. Communicate transparently on social media
4. Document downtime for potential credit/extension request

### If conversion rate is below target by Hour 6:
1. Review page analytics — where are visitors dropping off?
2. Check pricing — is the value proposition clear?
3. Test alternative hero image or headline
4. Increase paid ad budget on best-performing audience
5. Deploy founder personal outreach to warm leads

### If Day 1 target is clearly unreachable by Hour 12:
1. Shift narrative from "Day 1 goal" to "first 48 hours"
2. Extend early bird deadline by 24h (creates second urgency wave)
3. Activate backup outreach channels
4. Document lessons for campaign strategy adjustment
