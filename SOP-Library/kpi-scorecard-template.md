# KPI Scorecard Template
## The "Nervous System" Dashboard for Founders & Operators

> "If you can't see it on one screen, you can't manage it."

---

## Purpose

The KPI Scorecard is a **single-screen executive dashboard** that gives founders, operators, and leadership teams instant visibility into business health — without opening 5 tools, 12 spreadsheets, or asking 3 people.

This is the "nervous system" dashboard referenced throughout the Architect's framework. It's the first thing you build. It's the last thing you check before making any decision.

## Core Principles

### 1. One Screen Rule
If it doesn't fit on one screen, it's not a dashboard — it's a report. Dashboards are for instant reads. Reports are for deep dives. This is a dashboard.

### 2. Traffic Light System
Every metric gets a color:
- 🟢 **Green** = On track. No action needed.
- 🟡 **Yellow** = Trending off. Review within 48 hours.
- 🔴 **Red** = Off track. Action required within 24 hours.

### 3. The 5±2 Rule
No section should have more than 7 KPIs. Ideally 5. The human brain can hold 5±2 items in working memory. Respect that limit.

### 4. Leading > Lagging
Prioritize **leading indicators** (things you can still influence) over **lagging indicators** (things that already happened). Revenue is lagging. Pipeline is leading.

### 5. Owner + Cadence
Every KPI has an owner and an update cadence. A metric nobody owns is a metric nobody acts on.

## How to Build Your Scorecard

### Step 1: Select Your Template
Choose the industry-specific scorecard that matches your operation. If none fit exactly, start with the Universal template.

### Step 2: Set Targets
For each KPI, define what "good" looks like. Use historical data if available. If not, use industry benchmarks or educated estimates. You'll calibrate over time.

### Step 3: Define Thresholds
For each KPI, set the boundaries:
- What number = Green?
- What number = Yellow?
- What number = Red?

**Rule of thumb:**
- Green: Within 10% of target
- Yellow: 10-25% off target
- Red: More than 25% off target (or any safety/compliance issue)

### Step 4: Assign Owners
Every KPI needs exactly ONE owner. Not a team. Not "everyone." One human who is responsible for:
- Updating the number
- Investigating Yellow/Red status
- Proposing corrective action

### Step 5: Set Cadence
How often each KPI gets updated. Match the cadence to how fast the number can change:
- Revenue changes weekly → weekly update
- NPS changes slowly → quarterly update
- Safety incidents can happen anytime → daily update

### Step 6: Install Review Rhythm
The scorecard is useless if nobody looks at it:

| Review | Frequency | Participants | Duration |
|---|---|---|---|
| Quick scan | Daily | Operator/founder | 5 min |
| Operational review | Weekly | Team leads | 30 min |
| Strategic review | Monthly | Leadership | 60 min |
| Deep dive | Quarterly | Full team | Half-day |

## Scorecard Anti-Patterns

### ❌ The "Everything is Green" Scorecard
**Problem:** Thresholds are too generous. Everything always looks fine.
**Fix:** If nothing has been Yellow or Red in 3 months, your thresholds are too loose. Tighten them.

### ❌ The "Nobody Updates It" Scorecard
**Problem:** Dashboard was built but data goes stale.
**Fix:** Assign owners. If an owner misses 2 updates, escalate. The scorecard is only as good as its data.

### ❌ The "Too Many KPIs" Scorecard
**Problem:** 25+ metrics on one screen. Information overload.
**Fix:** Apply the 5±2 rule per section. If you can't explain why a KPI matters in one sentence, remove it.

### ❌ The "All Lagging" Scorecard
**Problem:** Every metric is a result (revenue, churn, satisfaction) with no leading indicators.
**Fix:** For every lagging indicator, add one leading indicator. Revenue is lagging → Pipeline value is leading. Churn is lagging → Usage frequency is leading.

### ❌ The "Vanity Metrics" Scorecard
**Problem:** Metrics that look good but don't drive decisions (total page views, social followers, etc.).
**Fix:** Every KPI must answer: "If this changes, what would we DO differently?" If the answer is nothing, remove it.

| **Forensic Audit Framework** | Audit findings become scorecard KPIs to track remediation |
| **Campaign Update Engine** | Live campaign KPIs trigger content and engagement actions |
| **Multi-Contractor Ops** | Construction scorecard drives daily sign-off and stage gates |
