# Juric OS | Operations & Systems Architecture

> "Most consultants sell hours. We install operating systems."

Engineering the operational "Nervous System" for founder-led businesses and high-stakes launches.

---

## What This Is

This repository contains the structural logic, SOPs, and operational frameworks behind **Juric OS** — a performance architecture that transforms founder-dependency into scalable, measurable execution.

This is not theory. Every framework here was built under pressure — global product launches, multi-contractor construction, city-wide infrastructure rollouts, and 5 crowdfunding campaigns across 3 continents.

**Core philosophy: Proof Before Promise™**
We don't start with a plan. We start with a forensic diagnosis. If the numbers don't support a GO decision — we say NO.

## The Method: 3-Phase Buildout

Every engagement follows the same disciplined architecture:

### Phase 1 — Forensic Audit *(Diagnosis)*
- **Operational mapping** — Where does time leak? Money leak? Decisions stall?
- **Readiness scoring** — Proprietary 100-point scale across 8 modules (🔴 🟡 🟢)
- **GO / NO-GO Verdict** — One clear answer. No ambiguity.
- **Critical blockers** — The 3-5 things that must be true before any spend.

### Phase 2 — Core Infrastructure *(Buildout)*
- **Nashville Architecture™** — Single source of truth for every process, KPI, and owner.
- **SOP Engine** — Processes that survive the founder leaving the room.
- **KPI Scorecards** — The 5-10 numbers that predict business health.
- **Accountability Rhythm** — Daily sign-offs, weekly reviews, 90-day sprints.

### Phase 3 — Scale & Sustain *(Optimization)*
- Revenue architecture and offer sequencing
- Team scaling by role design, not desperation
- Handoff protocol — the system runs without us

## Frameworks & Blueprints

### 🏗️ Nashville Architecture
Multi-divisional "Spoke-and-Hub" model where data flows automatically, not manually. Designed for founder-led businesses running multiple divisions (agency + venture + programs).
→ See: [Architecture-Schemas/Nashville-Venture-Studio.md](https://github.com/ladislavjuric-OS/Operations-Architecture-SOP/blob/main/Architecture-Schemas/Nashville-Venture-Studio.md)

### 🕸️ Spoke-and-Hub Model
Resource allocation architecture for operators managing multiple business units simultaneously. The 60/30/10 framework, conflict resolution protocol, and diagnostic checklist.
→ See: [Architecture-Schemas/Spoke-and-Hub-Model.md](https://github.com/ladislavjuric-OS/Operations-Architecture-SOP/blob/main/Architecture-Schemas/Spoke-and-Hub-Model.md)

## The Operational Scars Behind This

| Operation | Scale | What It Taught Us |
|---|---|---|
| **Consumer Tech — Global Launch** | $890K funding, logistics across EU/US/Asia/UAE | SOPs aren't optional — they're survival |
| **Luxury Construction** | 15 villas, 6 months, 35+ subcontractors | Your "operating system" is either real or catastrophic |
| **Telecom Infrastructure** | City-wide fiber deployment, 4-phase rollout | Zero room for improvisation |
| **Crowdfunding Campaigns** | 5 campaigns incl. Japan (CAMPFIRE), top 3 in Croatia | Every campaign is a launch system stress test |
