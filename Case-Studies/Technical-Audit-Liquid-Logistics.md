### MODULE 2.4: LIQUID INTEGRITY & LOGISTICS HAZARDS (Specialized Audit)
**Focus:** Physical product durability validation for global fulfillment.

* **Atmospheric Resilience:** Pressure & Altitude Simulation (IATA standards) to prevent leakage during Air Freight.
* **Thermal Stability:** Extreme Heat Cycle testing (+45°C) for global warehousing (e.g., UAE/US port exposure).
* **Kinetic Durability:** ISTA 1A Drop Test protocols and "Vibration Fatigue" (Back-off effect) mitigation.
* **Hazardous Compliance:** MSDS Review and Flash Point Validation to prevent 3x spikes in shipping costs.

> *Architect's Insight:* Managing liquids in global transit is managing a "living organism." If the expansion gap or induction sealing fails, the entire batch is a total loss. I bake these checkpoints into the production SOP before the first unit leaves the factory.
