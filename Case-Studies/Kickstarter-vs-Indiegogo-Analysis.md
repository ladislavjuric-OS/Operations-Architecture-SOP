# Kickstarter vs. Indiegogo
## Platform Analysis for Launch Strategy Selection

> "Choosing the wrong platform doesn't kill your product. It kills your margin of error."

---

## Purpose

This analysis provides an operational comparison of Kickstarter and Indiegogo for product launches — not from a "which is better" perspective, but from a **"which gives you the highest probability of success given YOUR specific situation"** framework.

Every platform decision should be made BEFORE the MVL gates are set. Switching platforms mid-preparation wastes 2-4 weeks minimum.

## Decision Matrix

### Choose Kickstarter When:

| Factor | Why |
|---|---|
| **Strong creative/design angle** | Kickstarter's audience actively seeks novel design and creative projects |
| **You want social proof pressure** | All-or-nothing creates urgency — "fund or lose it" |
| **You have a strong Day 1 plan** | Kickstarter's algorithm rewards early velocity MORE aggressively |
| **Product is in creative/lifestyle category** | Fashion, home goods, design objects, games, film |
| **You want "Projects We Love" potential** | Kickstarter's editorial team curates — this is a massive traffic boost |
| **Your audience is US/EU-centric** | Kickstarter's traffic is heavily Western |
| **You're confident in hitting your goal** | All-or-nothing means you need to hit 100% or get nothing |

### Choose Indiegogo When:

| Factor | Why |
|---|---|
| **Hardware/tech product** | Indiegogo's audience expects and backs tech products |
| **You want flexible funding** | Keep what you raise, even if you don't hit 100% |
| **InDemand matters** | Native post-campaign store (no BackerKit needed) |
| **Faster launch needed** | Less strict review process = faster go-live |
| **You have international audience** | Indiegogo has broader global reach, especially Asia |
| **You want agency/partner support** | Indiegogo has a more active partner ecosystem (agencies, marketing firms) |
| **Product is in tech/gadget/outdoor category** | Audience alignment is stronger |
| **You're testing market response** | Flexible funding lets you validate without the all-or-nothing risk |

## Detailed Comparison by Operational Dimension

### 1. Funding Model

**Kickstarter: All-or-Nothing**
- You set a goal. If you don't reach it, all money is returned to backers.
- **Advantage:** Creates urgency. Backers know their money is "safe" if the project doesn't fund.
- **Risk:** If you set the goal too high and miss by $100, you get nothing.
- **Strategic implication:** Set your goal at the MINIMUM viable amount, not your dream budget. Leave stretch goals for upside.

**Indiegogo: Flexible Funding (default)**
- You keep whatever you raise, regardless of goal.
- **Advantage:** No risk of losing everything. Good for market validation.
- **Risk:** Less urgency for backers. "It'll fund anyway" reduces FOMO.
- **Strategic implication:** Even with flexible funding, you need to CREATE urgency through limited perks and time-bound offers.

**Indiegogo: All-or-Nothing (option)**
- Same as Kickstarter model, available as an option.
- Rarely used — defeats the main Indiegogo advantage.

### 2. Algorithm & Discovery

**Kickstarter's Algorithm:**
- Heavily rewards first-48-hour velocity
- "Projects We Love" badge = massive organic traffic (editorial pick)
- Category trending is visible and drives traffic
- Staff picks appear on homepage
- **The 30% Day-1 Rule matters MORE on Kickstarter** because the algorithm amplifies early success

**Indiegogo's Algorithm:**
- "Trending" and "Most Funded" lists drive discovery
- Less editorial curation, more algorithm-driven
- InDemand campaigns compete with live campaigns for visibility
- Partner/agency campaigns often get preferential placement
- **The algorithm is less punishing for slow starts** but also less rewarding for fast ones

### 3. Post-Campaign (Critical Difference)

**Kickstarter:**
- Campaign ends → no native store
- Need BackerKit, PledgeManager, or similar for:
  - Late pledges
  - Add-ons
  - Surveys
  - Shipping address collection
- Additional cost: BackerKit charges per backer or percentage
- **Operational overhead:** Set up BackerKit BEFORE campaign ends

**Indiegogo InDemand:**
- Campaign ends → transitions to InDemand (native post-campaign store)
- Backers can continue pledging at adjusted prices
- Can run for months or years
- Same 5% platform fee applies
- **Operational advantage:** No third-party tool needed for post-campaign sales
- **Revenue advantage:** Many campaigns raise 30-50% of total revenue in InDemand

### 4. Backer Behavior

| Behavior | Kickstarter | Indiegogo |
|---|---|---|
| Average pledge | Higher (creative premium) | Lower (tech price sensitivity) |
| Refund rate | Lower (commitment to all-or-nothing) | Higher (flexible = less commitment) |
| Repeat backers | Strong community ("super backers") | Moderate |
| Comment engagement | Very high | Moderate |
| Social sharing | High ("I backed this" badge) | Moderate |
| International backers | 60-70% US | More geographically distributed |

### 5. Fee Comparison

| Fee Type | Kickstarter | Indiegogo |
|---|---|---|
| Platform fee | 5% | 5% |
| Payment processing | 3% + $0.20 | 3% + $0.30 |
| BackerKit (post-campaign) | ~2-3% or per-backer fee | N/A (InDemand is native) |
| **Effective total fee** | **~10-11%** (with BackerKit) | **~8%** (with InDemand) |

**Net savings on Indiegogo: ~2-3%** when accounting for post-campaign tools.

**Scoring guide:**
- 5 = Strong advantage for this platform
- 3 = Neutral
- 1 = Strong disadvantage for this platform

**Calculate:** (Score × Weight) for each platform. Higher total = recommended platform.

## Hybrid Strategy: Kickstarter → Indiegogo InDemand

The most sophisticated operators use BOTH platforms:

### The Play
1. **Launch on Kickstarter** — leverage the algorithm, urgency, and community
2. **Run 30-day campaign** — hit funding goal, build social proof
3. **Transition to Indiegogo InDemand** — open a "store" for continued sales
4. **Run InDemand for 6-12 months** — capture long-tail demand

### Why This Works
- Kickstarter's urgency drives a strong launch
- Indiegogo's InDemand captures revenue you'd otherwise lose
- Combined social proof ("Funded on Kickstarter, now available on Indiegogo")
- No BackerKit needed for post-campaign management

### The Catch
- You need to manage two platform relationships
- Kickstarter backers may feel "betrayed" if Indiegogo price is lower
- Operational complexity increases
- You need separate campaign pages, assets, and communication

### When to Use Hybrid
- Product has strong creative appeal (Kickstarter audience) AND long purchase cycle (InDemand)
- You expect significant post-campaign demand
- Your product category works on both platforms
- You have the operational capacity to manage both

## Common Mistakes

### 1. "Kickstarter has more traffic, so it's always better"
**Reality:** More traffic ≠ more relevant traffic. A tech gadget on Kickstarter competes with art and film for attention. On Indiegogo, it's the main event.

### 2. "Flexible funding means I don't need to worry about the goal"
**Reality:** A campaign that raises $2,000 of a $50,000 goal looks like a failure — even with flexible funding. Backers see the percentage and judge.

### 3. "I'll decide the platform later"
**Reality:** Platform choice affects page design, video strategy, perk structure, pricing, post-campaign tools, and marketing messaging. Decide EARLY.

### 4. "InDemand is just a bonus"
**Reality:** For hardware products, InDemand can be 30-50% of total revenue. It's not a bonus — it's a core revenue channel.

### 5. "The platform will bring me traffic"
**Reality:** Both platforms reward campaigns that bring their OWN traffic. The algorithm amplifies existing momentum — it doesn't create it.

## Operational Checklist by Platform

### If Launching on Kickstarter:
- [ ] Set goal at minimum viable amount (not dream budget)
- [ ] Prepare "Projects We Love" application materials
- [ ] Plan for 30% Day-1 (your warm list must be large enough)
- [ ] Set up BackerKit account BEFORE launch
- [ ] Prepare post-campaign transition communication
- [ ] Budget extra 2-3% for BackerKit fees

### If Launching on Indiegogo:
- [ ] Set goal to create perceived achievability (lower than Kickstarter equivalent)
- [ ] Create urgency artificially (limited perks, time-bound pricing)
- [ ] Plan InDemand transition from Day 1
- [ ] Leverage Indiegogo partner ecosystem (agencies, cross-promos)
- [ ] Prepare for higher refund rate (budget accordingly)
- [ ] Set up InDemand pricing strategy (must be higher than campaign price)
